/**
 * Use(s) relation in UML class diagrams. Describes relation
 * used usually when an object depends of another one - most often the "using"
 * end in a relationship will be aware of the other end it's using, but it's not
 * always the case the "used" end is aware who is using it. Implemented usually
 * when there is an input variable in a class' method which is type of another
 * class.
